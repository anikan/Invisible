# Invisible
An android game
-invisible text here-

A game where friends stalk each other by taking photos of them. The person with the most points in a single round wins.

The strategy is to get near the person without the other person seeing you, otherwise it'll devolve into a "take picture fest".
The radar on your phone can only pick up people who are currently on their phone, meaning if you see them on the radar, they see you too. If you catch someone first, you'll scramble their radar (to give you an opportunity to continue stealth).


The app verifies your geolocation and position of your phone to ensure you're not cheatin'.

What if your on the other side of the wall in a different room? What if you're in a tall building and on different floors? (e.g. someone hides in 2nd floor, guy on 1st floor just spams random direction and wins bc geolocation doesn't include altitutde)
What if you don't actually know where the other person is? (should the radar be directional to prevent this from happening?)
How do you invite someone to a game? (e.g. push notification to phone that you've been invited to a match?)
How long does a game last? Can the player decide time or points?
